# Devcash-bounties

Devcash is an ERC20 based currency for the developer economy.

Test it out on Ropsten here: https://ropsten.bdu.dev/ 

I'll be using this repo for bounties I hunt. The type of bounties I'm into are: 
- Helping the Devcash and BDU (Blockchain Developers United) community grow
- Provide tutorial ressources and learning material for the BDU community
- Proposing things to enhance the Devcash platform and governance
